*Art interpretation cue:* Depict a knight or traveler guiding a gentle, calm steed while offering a cup forward. The landscape should feel fluid and lyrical—a flowing river, a twilight sky, or a moonlit desert—to emphasize that this is a journey guided by the currents of intuition.

### Artistic Direction

Show a figure of poised yet passionate grace. The energy is one of forward momentum, but it is a smooth, flowing advance, not a charge. This is the envoy of love, and his approach is as important as his message.

*   **Core Symbolism & Composition:**
    *   **The Knight & Steed:** The knight’s armor is often adorned with fish or wave motifs, signifying his allegiance to the emotional realm. His helmet may have wings, linking him to the messenger god Hermes. The horse is typically calm and deliberate, lifting its hoof with grace, not aggression.
    *   **The Extended Cup:** The cup is held out before the rider, a clear symbol of an offer, an invitation, or the object of his quest.
    *   **The River Crossing:** The horse is often shown moving alongside or across a river, a classic symbol of traversing emotional landscapes and the flow of life.
    *   **The Sky:** A sunset or twilight sky captures the romantic, often idealized ambiance of the Knight’s mission.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Use a palette of shimmering silvers, soft blues, and rose golds. The scene should feel like a serenade on horseback—calm, purposeful, and deeply romantic.
