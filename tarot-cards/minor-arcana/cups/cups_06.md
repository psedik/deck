### Artistic Direction

This card invites a tableau of generous nostalgia—capture the glow of remembered safety while signalling that the past is a bridge, not a trap.

*   **Core Symbolism & Composition:**
    *   **Six Cups:** Arrange them at varied heights to suggest memories from different eras that still belong together. Let each act as a vessel for a distinct recollection.
    *   **Two Children:** Ages six to eight, relaxed and open. One offers, the other receives, illustrating the flow of trust and the innocence of reciprocal care.
    *   **Flowers in the Cups:** Favor small, fragrant blooms—hyacinth, iris, marigold—to evoke scent-triggered memory. Their presence shows emotion curated and uplifted rather than spilling over.
    *   **Courtyard & Manor:** A sun-washed, walled garden signals sanctuary, while the ancestral manor in the background hints at lineage and steady support without feeling ostentatious.
    *   **The Path & Watchful Figure:** A gently curving path leads beyond the scene, inviting forward motion. A softly rendered adult silhouette watches without interfering, assuring protection that allows freedom.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Bathe the scene in late-afternoon gold so the emotional temperature stays warm and hospitable. Keep textures soft—gloves, garments, flowers—with no harsh edges. The overall sentiment should be: the heart is safe here, and from that safety it can grow.

### Impression Palette

#### A Recollection

An old woman sat by her window, the scent of rain on hot stone reminding her of the courtyard from her youth. She remembered not a grand event, but a small, quiet one. A boy, barely older than her, had offered a clay cup—not with water, but with a single, perfect white flower inside. He hadn’t said a word; he had simply placed it in her hands and smiled. She had felt, in that moment, completely safe. The memory was not a place to live, she thought, but a garden to visit. She rose from her chair, went to her own small garden, and picked a flower. She placed it in a small vase and set it on the table for her guest, who was due to arrive any minute. The gift, she realized, is never truly gone if you continue to pass it on.

#### Limerick

A kind little boy from the past,
Gave a gift that was destined to last.
Not of silver or gold,
But a flower to hold,
In a memory lovingly cast.
