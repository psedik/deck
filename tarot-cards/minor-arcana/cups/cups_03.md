*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Employ a palette of warm golds, vibrant corals, and verdant greens. The environment could be a sun-drenched garden, an orchard at harvest time, or a festive communal courtyard. The overall feeling should be one of joyful invitation.

### Impression Palette

#### Toast

“To the joy that finds us in each other’s laughter. To the circle that holds us and keeps widening. To the vibrant, resilient music we make together.”

Hands clap rhythm into dusk—
Moonlight braids our hair.
Three voices climb into one,
Echoing the heart’s harvest.
