### Impression Palette

#### Toast

“To the joy that finds us in each other’s laughter, to the circle that keeps widening, to the music we make together.”

Grapes burst on the tongue.  
Hands clap rhythm into dusk—  
Moonlight braids our hair.  
Three voices climb into one,  
Echoing the heart’s harvest.
