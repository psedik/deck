*Art interpretation cue:* Center the exchange. The cup-to-cup flow and the gaze between figures should draw the eye, with subtle symbols of harmony surrounding them.

### Artistic Direction

Depict the moment when separate streams consciously weave into one. Let the figures, animals, or archetypes show equality, mutual respect, and the choice to meet.

*   **Core Symbolism & Composition:**
    *   **Pairing Figures:** Two people, beings, or mirrored aspects offering cups. Their stance should be open; hands or hearts in line. Consider subtle differences that show individuality within harmony.

    *   **Lion or Winged Symbol:** Above the figures to indicate passion blessed by higher wisdom. Could be stylized sun or guardian glyph.
    *   **Shared Ground:** A common foundation like a garden patio, shoreline, or threshold, representing a new sacred space created together.
    *   **Flow Between Cups:** Wine, water, or light connecting vessels to illustrate reciprocity.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Use warm golds and blush tones to evoke intimacy and trust. The lighting should feel like golden hour—soft, welcoming, and rich with possibility.

### Impression Palette

#### Vignette

Two dancers met at the water’s edge, cups in hand. “I bring my tides,” one said. “I bring my moon,” the other replied. They poured their waters into a shared bowl and watched the surface shimmer in colors neither had seen alone.

#### Couplet

Hand to hand, the vow is spun—  
Two hearts beating now as one.
