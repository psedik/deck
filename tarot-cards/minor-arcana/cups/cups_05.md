### Visual symbols (common across decks, esp. RWS)

*   **Cloaked Figure:** Represents mourning and being wrapped up in sorrow. The posture should be one of dejection, head bowed.
*   **Three Spilled Cups:** Symbolize the specific losses or disappointments being mourned. The spilled liquid represents wasted emotion or opportunity.
*   **Two Upright Cups:** Represent the opportunities and potential that still remain, though they are currently unseen or ignored by the figure.
*   **River:** Symbolizes the flow of emotion, and in this card, the current of grief.
*   **Bridge:** Represents a path forward, a way to move on from the current state of sorrow.
*   **Distant Castle/Home:** Symbolizes the safety, stability, and resolution that can be reached by crossing the bridge.

### Scene dynamics

The scene should feel heavy and melancholic. The figure is the focal point, consumed by the spilled cups in the foreground. The upright cups and the bridge in the background should be present but not draw immediate attention, emphasizing the theme of overlooking the positive while dwelling on the negative.
