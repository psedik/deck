*Art interpretation cue:* Let seven vessels hover in a cloudscape or dream chamber, each holding a different symbol—some blessings, some illusions. The figure below should appear entranced yet uncertain.

### Artistic Direction

Render a liminal space where possibility blurs with deception. Use contrast between alluring imagery and shadowed undertones.

*   **Core Symbolism & Composition:**
    *   **Seven Cups Aloft:** Fill them with archetypal symbols—crown, serpent, jewels, laurel, castle, dragon, dove—to show varied choices.
    *   **Veiled Figure:** Someone gazing upward, arms raised or hesitating, symbolizing the human confronted with many dreams.
    *   **Clouds or Mist:** Represent the mental/emotional fog; the scene feels otherworldly.
    *   **Light & Shadow Play:** Some cups brightly illuminated, others looming or partially obscured.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Experiment with iridescent blues, purples, and silver. Incorporate glows, starbursts, or sparkles to show allure, with subtle shadows hinting at the need for discernment.

### Esoteric Correspondences

#### Dream Log Entry

I stood in a cathedral of mist. Cups circled me, each humming a different note. I touched the cup shaped like a heart, and every other vision faded, leaving a single doorway lit with soft blue fire. I stepped through, carrying only what sang back to me.
