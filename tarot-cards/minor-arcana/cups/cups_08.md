*Art interpretation cue:* Depict a figure walking away from stacked cups toward distant mountains or a moonlit horizon. The arrangement of cups should feel deliberate yet incomplete, hinting at what is left behind.

“I stacked the cups with care before dawn. One remained out of place, like the note that never fit the chord. The moon opened a path across the water, and I followed, each step echoing with both ache and relief.”

Moonlit resolve.  
Each footstep blesses change;  
The tide hums softly, ‘Carry on.’  
Release.
