    *   **Three Cups on the Ground:** Represent existing experiences or offers, aligned to show stability but perhaps stagnation.
    *   **Floating or Offered Cup:** A hand from a cloud, tree spirit, or luminous presence extending a new emotional opportunity.
    *   **Tree or Canopy:** Shelter symbolizing protection during introspection; include roots/moss to convey groundedness.
    *   **Muted Landscape:** Minimal movement, subdued palette—mist, drizzle, or filtered light through leaves.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Use cool blues, soft greens, and greyed tones. Let the offered cup glow faintly to contrast with the muted surroundings.
