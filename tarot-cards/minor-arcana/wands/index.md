The journey through the Wands is a quest of will and creation. It begins with the **Ace**, a single spark of divine inspiration. It moves to the bold planning of the **Two** and the initial expansion of the **Three**, leading to the joyful celebration of the **Four**. It navigates the creative chaos of the **Five** to achieve the public victory of the **Six**. It finds the courage to stand its ground in the **Seven**, then rides the swift momentum of the **Eight** to build the resilience of the **Nine**. Finally, it confronts the **Ten**, where the fire of creation can become the burden of responsibility.
