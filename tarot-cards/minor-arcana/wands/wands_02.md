*Art interpretation cue:* Portray a figure standing at a parapet or threshold, holding a wand while another is anchored beside them. A globe, map, or horizon should emphasize strategic foresight and the pull of distant possibility.

### Artistic Direction

Capture the stillness before departure—the contemplative pause where power gathers as plans crystallize.

*   **Core Symbolism & Composition:**
    *   **Dual Wands:** One wand is gripped, symbolizing active choice; the other is secured to the wall, showing established authority. Together they frame the decision to expand beyond the familiar.
    *   **The Outlook:** A castle balcony, cliffside vista, or high tower underscores the command of perspective. Distant mountains, rivers, or ships hint at the world waiting to be claimed.
    *   **The Globe or Map:** Include a globe, compass, or parchment to reinforce visionary planning and the desire to explore.
    *   **Red Robes or Solar Motifs:** Draw on Aries imagery—bold colors, ram emblems, or blazing sunlight—to reflect courageous intent.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Use vibrant reds, sunlit golds, and terra-cotta tones. Lighting should be clear and direct, suggesting determination and clarity.
