*Art interpretation cue:* Depict multiple figures wielding wands in a lively tussle. The scene should feel kinetic—more like a sparring match than a war—suggesting practice, rivalry, or the rehearsal stage before mastery.

### Artistic Direction

Portray conflict as a fiery workshop. The goal is not destruction but evolution through pressure, resistance, and play.

*   **Core Symbolism & Composition:**
    *   **Five Combatants:** Each figure expresses different styles or personalities, symbolizing competing ideas, egos, or approaches.
    *   **Crossed Wands:** The staves form X- or star-shaped intersections, showing tension, entanglement, and dynamic interplay.
    *   **Rough Terrain:** Uneven ground or unfinished structures remind us this arena is still in development—nothing is fixed yet.
    *   **Bright Sky:** Keep the palette energetic and sunlit to underscore that this is not a dire battle but a spirited challenge.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Use fiery oranges, scarlet flashes, and electric yellows. Motion lines, flying sparks, or dust clouds help communicate kinetic energy.
