# Ten of Swords

*Art interpretation cue:* Portray a figure lying prone with ten swords piercing their back under a darkened sky. Beyond, the horizon should brighten, signaling new beginnings beyond the ending.

    *   **Dark Clouds:** The crisis has peaked; the worst has happened.
    *   **Rising Sun:** New hope already appearing; endings make room for rebirth.
*   **Mood & Atmosphere:**
    Use inky blacks, steel grays, and blood reds, contrasted with a blaze of gold on the horizon. Let light break through resolutely.
