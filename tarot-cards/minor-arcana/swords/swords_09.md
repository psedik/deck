*Art interpretation cue:* Illustrate a figure sitting up in bed, head in hands, as nine swords hang on the wall like intrusive thoughts. The darkness should be punctuated by subtle hints of dawn or spiritual solace.

### Impression Palette

#### Midnight Journal Entry

“03:17. The swords glimmer above me like accusations. I breathe, name each fear aloud, and wait for dawn to answer back.”

#### Sestet Fragment

Nine blades hum behind my eyes—  
phantoms etched in restless light.  
Yet even shadows learn to rise  
when whispered kindness softens night.  
I turn my face toward the seams  
where daybreak threads through anxious dreams.
